# Hack space for learning more about OOP

Trying to build a quiz app
Following instructions from: http://javascriptissexy.com/oop-in-javascript-what-you-need-to-know/

Could not get this code to work:
"main.js:79 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined"

Strict mode does not work at all.
